The variables in the tables produced by the run_analysis() script have been
translated to make them human-readable.

Variables begin either:
- Body. Which means the portion of the data attributable to body movement. It 
        it was distinguished from the portion due to gravity using a high-pass
	filter.
OR
- Gravity. Which means the portion of the data attributable to gravity

Next the variable names include a description of the quantity measured. These
can include:
- Acceleration. As measured by the phone's accelerometer.
- Acceleration.Jerk. This is the derivative of acceleration.
- Gyroscopic. Angular momentum as measured by the phone's gyroscope.
- Gyroscopic.Jerk. This is the derivative of angular momentum.

Next the variable names include a description of the measurement. Either:
- StandardDeviation
OR
- Mean

Next the variable names include a description of the dimension of the
measurement. It is one of:
- XAxis
- YAxis
- ZAxis
or
- Magnitude, which indicates a scalar

Finally, the variable name indicates whether the measurement is expressed in
the time domain or in the frequency domain.
